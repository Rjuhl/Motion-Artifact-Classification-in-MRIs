# Motion-Artifact-Classification-in-MRIs
Identifying motion artifacts in MRI scans is an important and costly process that requires an expert to closely examine a scan 
after it is taken. Ideally, after a scan, a computer would be able to recognize an artifact and prompt for a re-scan thus saving time and money. 
To address this problem lots of research has been done to recognize these artifacts with higher and higher accuracies. Here I look at how a simple 
MLP Binary Classifier performs on the NCANDA dataset.
